  <!-- Export lib so that users of youtube-dl and yt-dlp can access them.
       Normally, it would be cleaner to have these two libs in separate addon,
       since this extension point makes them shared with other addons, while
       the rest of the code (service.py) is not.
       However, since this addon's code is contained in a single short file,
       AND the exported directory (lib) completely contains only the shared
       code, then it seems it may be a bit much to split this into two addons. -->
